    "Ira": `Dear Aanya,

I have a tendency of making friends with everyone, and one of the closest friends I have made over the years... aanya is one of the best ones.
She is one of those people I can always trust with my emotions and feelings and even when I need a good laugh.

Even tho we don't meet often, or even text as much... I always know that she will be there for me, like I for her.

I love you Aanya, you were the person with me when I was going through so much... the one who sticked with me and just gave me space to grow.

I hope that our bond stays like this even when we might not see each other a lot.
I hope you still laugh and say the most randomest things ever that crack me up the most.

Happiest Birthday Aanya,

Love Ira ♡`,

    "Shreya": `Aanya, happy birthday!!
You are such a kind soul and an awesome person all around.
Your presence is so comforting and talking to you is so easy because you are literally an angel.

Thank you for being my friend.

Love ya!
