"Ira": `Dear Aanya,

I have a tendency of making friends with everyone, and one of the closest friends I have made over the years...aanya is one of the best ones. She is one of those people I can always trust with my emotions and feelings and even when I need a good laugh. Even tho we don't meet often, or even text as much...I always know that she will be there for me, like I for her. 
I love you Aanya, you were the person with me when I was going through so much... the one who sticked with me and just gave me space to grow and I hope that our bond stays like this even when we might not see eachother a lot. I hope you still, laugh and say the most randomest things ever that cracks me up the most. 

Happiest Birthday Aanya, 

Love Ira ♡`,
